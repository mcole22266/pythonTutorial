# HW2 - Strings 

## Assignment 
The first assignment is called `strings.py`. In this assignment, you'll find instructions 
written as comments that explain what to do for each problem. You need to create the function 
and then, underneath, call that function and have it demonstrate what was instructed. 


An example would look something like:    
```python
# Problem 1
# Create a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
def makeSum(num1, num2):
    total = num1 + num2
    return total

makeSum(42, 8)   # should return 50
```

### Instructions
1. Copy the assignment into a different file:
 - `cp strings.py stringsSolution.py`
2. Solve the assignment
3. Push the assignment up and let me know you're done
 - `git add stringSolution.py`
 - `git commit -m 'Completed stringSolution.py'`
 - `git push`
