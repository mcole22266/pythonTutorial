# 
# Problem 1
# 
# In Robert McCloskey’s book Make Way for Ducklings, the names of the
# ducklings are Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and
# Quack. This loop tries to output these names in order.
# 
# prefixes = "JKLMNOPQ"
# suffix = "ack"
# 
# for p in prefixes:
#     print(p + suffix)
# 
# Of course, that’s not quite right because Ouack and Quack are
# misspelled.
#
# Create a function, called ducklings, that prints out the correct
# names for the ducklings




#----------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# Problem 2
#
# Create a function, called twelve_table, that prints out a neatly
# formatted multiplication table, up to 12 x 12.
#



#----------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# Problem 3
#
# Write a function, called reverse_string, that reverses its string
# argument.
# 


#----------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# Problem 4
#
# Write a function, remove_letter, that removes all occurrences of a
# given letter from a string.
#



#----------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# Problem 5
#
# Write a function, count_substring, that counts how many
# non-overlapping occurences of a substring appear in a string. Takes
# two parameters, a string and a substring to count
