# Simple Python Data

## The Assignment 
In the file `errors.py` you will see that it is full of errors. Ex: `python errors.py` will return an error rather than 
print something to the screen. Your goal is to fix all of these errors so that the above command will print the 
required items to the screen. 

There are three types of errors here:
- **syntax** errors
- **runtime** errors
- **semantic** errors    

## Instructions
1. Make a copy of `errors.py` by typing the following:
 - `cp errors.py errorsSolution_yourname.py`
 	- The way copy works is `cp FileToCopy NewNameOfCopiedFile`
2. Fix all of the errors
 - `python errorsSolution_yourname.py` should return no errors and only print statements
3. When complete, use git to push `errorsSolution_yourname.py` up to the repo:
 - `git add errorsSolution_yourname.py`
 - `git commit -m 'Completed errors.py'`
 - `git push`
4. When complete, let me know so I can double check.
