# HW 1 - Simple Python Data

## The Assignment 
In the file `hw1.py` you will see that it is full of errors. Ex: `python hw1.py` will return an error rather than 
print something to the screen. Your goal is to fix all of these errors so that the above command will print the 
required items to the screen. 


There are three types of errors here:
- **syntax** errors
- **runtime** errors
- **semantic** errors    

## Instructions
1. Make a copy of `hw1.py` by typing the following:
 - `cp hw1.py hw1Solution.py`
2. Fix all of the errors
 - `python hw1Solution.py` should return no errors and only print statements
3. When complete, use git to push `hw1Solutions.py` up to the repo:
 - `git add hw1Solutions.py`
 - `git commit -m 'Completed hw1Solutions.py'`
 - `git push`
4. When complete, let me know so I can double check.
